Dare To Laugh GDD

Theme: Try to Make Me Laugh

Game Concept: A game where a player experiences being a soldier trying to impress the dictator with a laugh at the right time.

Goal:
Satisfy the dictator to the fullest by filling up the mood's bar.

Control
Press a Spacebar: To Laugh

Mechanics: 
Mood Bar:
A dictator has a mood bar. If this mood's bar is empty, the dictator will get angry, and the player loses the game. However, if the mood bar is full, the player wins the game.
The higher the mood bar, the faster dialogue box's speed will be.

Dialogue Box:
The dialogue box will randon a string that contains both alphabets and emoticons. The important emoticons are a duck and a tank. If there are more duck emoticons, the player has to laugh to increase the mood bar, otherwise the mood bar will decrease. On the other hand, if there are more tanks, the player should not laugh, otherwise the mood bar will decrease.

Timing Gauge(Pangya Gauge)
Once the dictator has finished talking (the dialogue box has ended), the timing gauge will appear for a short period of the time.
If the player laughs or doesn't laugh correctly, the mood bar's gauge will increase. If the player fails the action including pressing before the timing gauge appears, laughing at the wrong time(outside of the target area), and laughing when the player should not laugh, the laugh gauge will decrease.

Random Dialogue Logic:
should be able to play at different speed
should be able to generate the amount of text and emoticons at will.
should be able to generate text and emoticons  at the last sentence.
